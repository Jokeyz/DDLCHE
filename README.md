To install the compiled build of the game you must have an existing install of Doki Doki Literature Club.
You can get yourself one over at https://ddlc.moe/

Assuming you have a working install, click the "Clone or Download" button here on github and then "Download as Zip". Extract the contents into the "game" directory of your DDLC install. After that, just delete the "scripts.rpa" file to prevent any script conflicts. From there, the mod should start up fine. If you have any issues, please contact SpudManTwo.
